The "upstream" remote is usually used when you want to contribute to a project. After you clone a repo and connect it to 
github, by default it will have an origin that points to your github repo. So it will not point to the original 
repository of the project you want to contribute to. In order to keep track of the original repository of the project
you can add another remote called "upstream" like this:

git remote add upstream git://github.com/user/repo.git
