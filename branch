A branch is a repository you can create as a copy of the repository you are working on. It will have all the files
and the commits that the Master repository has until the moment you created the branch. From that moment onwards,
you can work separately on the Master and on the branch and the changes made on one will not affect the other, unless
you decide to merge or rebase.
